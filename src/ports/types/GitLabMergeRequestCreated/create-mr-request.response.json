  "title": "Strings should be compared using equals()",
  "description": "Using the equality (`==`) and inequality (`!=`) operators to compare two strings does not check to see if\nthey have the same values. Rather it checks to see if both object references point to exactly the same object\nin memory. The vast majority of the time, this is not what you want to do.\n\nUse the `.equals()` method to compare a string object to a string literal.\n\n### Noncompliant Code Sample\n\n```java\nString blueHardcoded = \"blue\";\nString blueViaConstructor = new String(\"blue\"); // this is the same as if blueViaConstructor was read from a file, an HTTP request, console input, etc.\n\nif (blueHardcoded == \"blue\") {\n    System.out.println(\"blueHardcoded is \\\"blue\\\"\"); // prints\n}\nif (blueViaConstructor == \"blue\") {\n    System.out.println(\"blueViaConstructor is \\\"blue\\\"\"); // DOESN'T print\n}\nif (blueHardcoded != \"blue\") {\n    System.out.println(\"blueHardcoded is not \\\"blue\\\"\"); // DOESN'T print\n}\nif (blueViaConstructor != \"blue\") {\n    System.out.println(\"blueViaConstructor is not \\\"blue\\\"\"); // prints\n}\n```\n\n### Compliant Solution\n\n```java\nString blueHardcoded = \"blue\";\nString blueViaConstructor = new String(\"blue\"); // this is the same as if blueViaConstructor was read from a file, an HTTP request, console input, etc.\n\nif (blueHardcoded.equals(\"blue\")) {\n    System.out.println(\"blueHardcoded is \\\"blue\\\"\"); // prints\n}\nif (blueViaConstructor.equals(\"blue\")) {\n    System.out.println(\"blueViaConstructor is \\\"blue\\\"\"); // prints\n}\nif (!blueHardcoded.equals(\"blue\")) {\n    System.out.println(\"blueHardcoded is not \\\"blue\\\"\"); // DOESN'T print\n}\nif (!blueViaConstructor.equals(\"blue\")) {\n    System.out.println(\"blueViaConstructor is not \\\"blue\\\"\"); // DOESN'T print\n}\n```",
