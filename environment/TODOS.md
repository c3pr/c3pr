# TODOs

- BRAIN: listen to ToolInvocationFailed and behave the same as TIC

- GITLAB: add new project if project of given url not found (when creating ChangesCommitted, see `convertWebhookToChanges()`)

- TIC: add status (to indicate failure)

- DASHBOARD: add button that calls -repo to test if the bot can read the project.
